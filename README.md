# Introduction to information retrieval and text mining, Fall 2020

The course is aimed at graduate students who are interested in information retrieval and text mining. the first part of the course will cover the basics of information retrieval, including the manner of document representation, term weighting, and evaluation metrics used to compare information retrieval systems. Then, research topics, such as text classification and clustering, will be discussed to provide a comprehensive study on information retrieval and text mining.

This repo contains my solutions to the homework as well as the final project.

## Midterm project
We solved a real-world operation research questions.\
Please refer to the `./MidTermProject` directory for project questions and our solution.

## Final project
We built a snake game with SFML, I was responsible for algorithm designing and degugging in our team.
Please refer to the `./FinalProject` directory for the instructions to run this program.
